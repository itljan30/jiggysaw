# Inspiration
This project was inspired by [How can a jigsaw have two distinct solutions?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b5nElEbbnfU&t=1212s) by Stand-up Maths on YouTube.
I started this project around the time the video came out in Python, but never finished it. This is a revival of that project in Rust this time using all the new
knowledge I have gained since then. 
This project doesn't do much to build upon its inspiration, but it was originally meant as a test just to see if I could do it. 
I started programming in April 2024 and I'm proud of how much I've been able to accomplish in that little time.
